igovccpt	Countercyclical-type payments are made to producers of eligible crops, based on historical production of program crops, but the payment rates depend on market prices.  The countercyclical payment (CCP) program that began with the 2002 Farm Act ended in 2014, as did the countercyclical Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program. Two new countercyclical-type programs have since been established: the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program and the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program.
